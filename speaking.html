        <p></p><br> 
        <p>Agreeing phrases</p>

<li>I think the same as well.</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
<li>I couldn't have said it better myself.</li>
<li>I concur with you. (very formal)</li>
<li>I am of the same opinion.</li>
<li>You're right.</li>
<br>
<p>Disagreeing phrases</p>
<p>Remember after you use these phrases you first have to make it clear what you disagree with. After this, you have justify why you think what the the other person has said is wrong:</p>
<br>
<li>I'm sceptical that... </li>
<li>I have my doubts whether... </li>
<li>Maybe it's me, but I can't see... </li>

        <p>How you open your statements is your first opportunity to impress the examiner. Making a good first impression will boost your chance of getting a high band score. </p>

         <br>
        <p></p>
        <p>Closing statements</p>
        <p>The manner in how you end your statements plays a vital role in the IELTS speaking test too. It shows how fluent you are and how coherent your responses are. </p>
